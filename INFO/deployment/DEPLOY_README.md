## 🚨 **Important Security Notes**

### **After Successful Deployment:**
1. **Delete** `artisan-web.php` immediately after use
2. **Delete** `staging-test.php` in production (keep for staging)

4. **Check** storage/ folder permissions are 755 (not 777)

### **File Structure Verification:**
```
✅ index.php (root entry point)
✅ .htaccess (URL rewriting)  
✅ app/ (controllers, models)
✅ resources/views/ (all Blade templates)
✅ public/ (assets: CSS, JS, images)
✅ vendor/ (Laravel framework + dependencies)
✅ storage/ (writable directories)
✅ .env (environment configuration)
```
