# Laravel Password Management Across Development Environments

I'm working with a Laravel application that follows this deployment flow:
**Local Development → Staging → Production**

I need help understanding and implementing best practices for managing user passwords across these environments. Here are my specific concerns:

## Current Scenario:
- I develop locally and push changes to staging for user testing
- Staging gets deployed to production via git branch merges
- Users change their passwords on the production site
- When I need to test new features on staging, the password data is outdated

## Questions I Need Help With:

### 1. Password Storage & Security
- How does Laravel hash and store passwords in the database?
- What happens to password hashes when code moves between environments?
- Are there security implications I should be aware of?

### 2. Database Management Strategy
- Should user passwords be included in database seeds or migrations?
- How do I handle the situation where production has newer user data than staging?
- What's the best way to sync user accounts for testing without compromising security?

### 3. Environment-Specific Configuration
- How should I configure Laravel's authentication settings across environments?
- What environment variables should be different between staging and production?
- How do I ensure password reset functionality works correctly in each environment?

### 4. Deployment Best Practices
- Should I ever copy production user data (including passwords) to staging?
- How do I create test accounts for staging that don't interfere with production?
- What's the safest way to handle user authentication during the deployment process?

### 5. Practical Solutions
- Can you suggest a workflow for managing test users on staging?
- How do I handle cases where stakeholders need to test with realistic data?
- What tools or Laravel features can help automate this process?

## My Current Setup:
- Laravel application with standard authentication
- Using git for version control
- Separate databases for each environment
- VS Code as development environment

Please provide code examples, configuration suggestions, and step-by-step guidance for implementing a secure and practical password management strategy across my development pipeline.
