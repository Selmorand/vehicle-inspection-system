  "Apply the same CSS mask solution we just implemented for body panels to the interior assessment       
  section. Specifically:

  1. Use the same CSS mask approach: PNG alpha channel as mask, background-color as tint
  2. Change from <img> to <div> elements for interior panel overlays
  3. Apply inline mask properties: mask-image: url('/images/panels/interior-panel.png')
  4. Use CSS variables for condition colors (--good, --average, --poor)
  5. Only show panels with conditions using the same logic
  6. Preserve exact positioning from interior panel CSV data
  7. Keep transparent areas transparent, only tint the solid/opaque parts of interior PNG images

  The goal is to achieve the same result as body panels: interior panel shapes get tinted with 
  condition colors while transparent areas remain transparent, no background rectangles or filters       
  that affect transparency.

  Reference the completed body panel implementation in the web-report.blade.php for the exact CSS        
  mask technique."
