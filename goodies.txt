   Project Status Summary:
  Working on vehicle inspection system - Body Panel Assessment feature
  - Using Laravel 12, PHP 8.2, Bootstrap 5.3.2
  - Frontend-only implementation (no backend yet)
  - Location: F:\xampp\htdocs\vehicle-inspection\

  Current Implementation:
  - Base vehicle image: FullVehicle.jpg (1005x1353px)
  - Windscreen panel positioned and working with color changes
  - Interactive two-way highlighting between panel and form
  - Responsive design implemented

  Panel Positioning Formula:
  - CorelDraw uses bottom-left origin (0,0)
  - CSS uses top-left origin
  - Conversion: CSS Y = 1353 - CorelDraw Y
  - Example: Windscreen Y in CorelDraw = 1003, CSS Y = 350

  Color System:
  - Good: #277020 (green)
  - Average: #f5a409 (orange)
  - Bad: #c62121 (red)
  - Colors persist after selection

  Files to Reference:
  - /resources/views/body-panel-assessment.blade.php
  - /public/images/panels/ (contains FullVehicle.jpg and panel images)
  - /panelImages.csv (contains panel coordinates from CorelDraw)

  Next Steps:
  1. Add remaining panel images from CSV
  2. Apply same positioning formula for each panel
  3. Create form fields for each panel assessment
  4. Implement backend when frontend is complete
