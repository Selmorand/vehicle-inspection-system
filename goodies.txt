   Project Status Summary:
  Working on vehicle inspection system - Body Panel Assessment feature
  - Using Laravel 12, PHP 8.2, Bootstrap 5.3.2
  - Frontend-only implementation (no backend yet)
  - Location: F:\xampp\htdocs\vehicle-inspection\

  Current Implementation:
  - Base vehicle image: FullVehicle.jpg (1005x1353px)
  - Windscreen panel positioned and working with color changes
  - Interactive two-way highlighting between panel and form
  - Responsive design implemented

  Panel Positioning Formula:
  - CorelDraw uses bottom-left origin (0,0)
  - CSS uses top-left origin
  - Conversion: CSS Y = 1353 - CorelDraw Y
  - Example: Windscreen Y in CorelDraw = 1003, CSS Y = 350

  Color System:
  - Good: #277020 (green)
  - Average: #f5a409 (orange)
  - Bad: #c62121 (red)
  - Colors persist after selection

  Files to Reference:
  - /resources/views/body-panel-assessment.blade.php
  - /public/images/panels/ (contains FullVehicle.jpg and panel images)
  - /panelImages.csv (contains panel coordinates from CorelDraw)

  Next Steps:
  1. Add remaining panel images from CSV
  2. Apply same positioning formula for each panel
  3. Create form fields for each panel assessment
  4. Implement backend when frontend is complete

## This is too push to staging
git add .
git commit -m "change the png for full vehicle"
git push origin main

```
## When I make simple changes

claude-code "Deploy to staging: commit changes and push to GitHub. My GitHub Actions will automatically deploy to alpha.selpro.co.za. Then check the staging URL to verify deployment."

### Method 1: Simple Deploy Command

**In VS Code terminal, run:**
```bash
claude-code "Deploy my current local changes to staging. Use the deployment config file to package files correctly for Laravel shared hosting, commit to git, and upload via FTP. Show me each step."
```

### Method 2: Step-by-Step with Confirmation

**For more control:**
```bash
claude-code "Help me deploy to staging step by step. First, show me what files have changed since last commit, then ask if I want to continue with deployment."
```

### Method 3: Quick Update Command

**For small changes:**
```bash
claude-code "Quick staging update: commit current changes with a descriptive message, create deployment package, and upload to staging server."
```

## Claude Code Commands You Can Use

### Development Commands

```bash
# Check what's changed
claude-code "Show me what files I've modified since last git commit, and suggest a good commit message."

# Prepare for deployment
claude-code "Prepare my Laravel project for staging deployment. Create deployment package with correct structure for shared hosting."

# Test before deploy
claude-code "Run Laravel tests and check for any issues before I deploy to staging."
```

### Deployment Commands

```bash
# Full deployment
claude-code "Deploy to staging: 1) Commit changes to git 2) Create deployment package 3) Upload via FTP 4) Test staging URL"

# Just create package
claude-code "Create a staging deployment package with correct Laravel structure for shared hosting, but don't upload yet."

# Upload existing package
claude-code "Upload the deployment package to staging server using FTP credentials from config file."
```

### Monitoring Commands

```bash
# Check staging status
claude-code "Check if my staging site at alpha.selpro.co.za is working correctly and compare with local version."

# View staging logs
claude-code "Help me check staging server logs for any errors after deployment."

# Rollback if needed
claude-code "Something went wrong with staging. Help me rollback to the previous version."
```

## Advanced Claude Code Workflows

### Database Migrations

```bash
claude-code "I've added new database migrations. Deploy to staging and run migrations safely."
```

### Asset Compilation

```bash
claude-code "I've updated CSS/JS files. Compile assets and deploy to staging with cache busting."
```

### Configuration Updates

```bash
claude-code "I need to update staging environment variables. Help me modify the .env file on the server."
```

### Multiple Changes

```bash
claude-code "I've made several features: updated user dashboard, fixed validation bugs, and added new reports. Create a comprehensive deployment with proper commit messages for each feature."
```

## Troubleshooting with Claude Code

### When Deployment Fails

```bash
claude-code "My staging deployment failed. Help me diagnose the issue and fix it."
```

### When Staging Shows Errors

```bash
claude-code "My staging site shows a Laravel error. Help me debug by checking logs and common issues."
```

### When Files Don't Update

```bash
claude-code "My changes aren't showing on staging. Help me verify the deployment and clear any caches."
```

## Benefits of This Approach

‚úÖ **Natural Language**: Just describe what you want to do
‚úÖ **Context Aware**: Claude Code understands Laravel and deployment patterns  
‚úÖ **Flexible**: Can handle different types of deployments
‚úÖ **Learning**: Claude Code explains each step as it happens
‚úÖ **Safe**: Can ask for confirmation before critical steps
‚úÖ **Comprehensive**: Handles git, packaging, FTP, and testing

## Example Complete Workflow

```bash
# 1. Morning: Start with updates
claude-code "Pull latest changes from git and show me what's new since yesterday."

# 2. After making changes
claude-code "I've updated the vehicle inspection form validation. Deploy this to staging for testing."

# 3. Test staging
claude-code "Test my staging deployment at alpha.selpro.co.za and verify the form validation works correctly."

# 4. If good, prepare for production
claude-code "Staging tests passed. Prepare this for production deployment with proper production environment settings."
```

## Custom Deployment Patterns  git push origin main

You can create custom patterns for your specific needs:

```bash
# For UI changes
claude-code "I've updated the dashboard design. Deploy to staging, compile assets, and clear browser cache."

# For database changes  
claude-code "I've added new database columns. Deploy to staging, run migrations, and verify data integrity."

# For API changes
claude-code "I've updated API endpoints. Deploy to staging and test all API functionality."

# For bug fixes
claude-code "I've fixed the image upload bug. Quick deploy to staging for urgent testing."
```

## Configuration Management

Claude Code can help manage different environments:

```bash
# Environment-specific deployments
claude-code "Deploy to staging with debug enabled, but prepare production package with debug disabled."

# Configuration validation
claude-code "Check my deployment configuration and environment files for any security issues or missing settings."

# Multi-environment sync
claude-code "Keep staging and production configurations in sync, but with environment-appropriate database and API settings."
```

Laranvel Snappy for pdf

 "Use the InspectionCards reusable system from public/js/inspection-cards.js and 
  public/css/panel-cards.css to add panel cards with camera functionality to inspection/tyres-rims. Follow the single instruction pattern from INSPECTION_CARDS_USAGE.md."

  ‚óè For the Body Panel Assessment, use this prompt tomorrow:

  "Add test report functionality to Body Panel Assessment using the TestReportHandler  
  module. The form ID is 'body-panel-form', sessionStorage key is 'bodyPanelData', and 
  it should show body panel conditions, comments, and any captured images in the test  
  report with working image modals."

  This will:
  - Add the Test Report View button to the body panel page
  - Capture all form data including panel conditions and comments
  - Include any images from the InspectionCards camera functionality
  - Use the same modal system we perfected for Visual Inspection
  - Create a test endpoint for viewing the body panel report

  The TestReportHandler module will handle everything automatically - just need to
  initialize it with those parameters.
