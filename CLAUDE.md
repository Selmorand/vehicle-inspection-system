# CLAUDE.md - Vehicle Inspection System Development

## Project Overview
Building a web-based vehicle inspection system for tablet use, designed for field inspectors to complete reports, capture photos, and generate professional PDFs. The system features interactive body panel assessment with visual highlighting and comprehensive reporting capabilities.

## Developer Background
- **Not a professional developer** - need beginner-friendly explanations
- **WordPress experience** - familiar with PHP and basic web concepts  
- **VS Code user** - comfortable with the editor
- **XAMPP setup** - developing locally on F: drive
- **HTML/CSS knowledge** - basic frontend skills
- **Very little JavaScript** - need guidance with complex JS
- **Learning Laravel** - first Laravel project, explain concepts clearly

## Technology Stack

### Current Setup
- **Laravel 12.0** - PHP web framework
- **PHP 8.2** - Required version
- **MySQL** - Database (via XAMPP, not SQLite)
- **Bootstrap 5.3.2** - CSS framework (chosen over Tailwind for familiarity)
- **Blade** - Laravel templating engine
- **Vanilla JavaScript** - No frameworks, keeping it simple

## Communication & Development Preferences

### Code Explanations
- **Explain the "why"** behind Laravel concepts and structure
- **Provide complete file contents** when possible
- **Use artifacts for large code blocks** - easier to copy
- **Specify exact file paths** - no ambiguity about locations
- **Include step-by-step testing** after each implementation

### Development Approach
1. **Section by section** - complete frontend, then add backend
2. **Copy-paste friendly** - provide complete, working code
3. **Minimal dependencies** - avoid complex packages when possible
4. **Progressive enhancement** - build basic functionality first
5. **Mobile-first design** - tablet optimization is priority

### File Organization Preferences
- **Separate CSS files** - keep styles in `public/css/inspection.css`
- **Minimal inline styles** - use CSS classes instead

- **Fast interaction** - responsive touch targets and smooth animations
- **Professional appearance** - builds client confidence
- **Reliable operation** - works consistently in field conditions

### Technical Requirements
- **Tablet-optimized performance** - smooth scrolling and interaction
- **Offline resilience** - graceful handling of connection issues
- **Data integrity** - accurate capture and storage of inspection data
- **Scalability** - support for multiple concurrent inspectors

## Code Style & Standards

### PHP/Laravel
- Follow PSR-12 coding standards
- Use Laravel naming conventions (PascalCase for classes, snake_case for variables)
- Keep controllers thin, use services for business logic
- Prefer Eloquent ORM over raw SQL queries

### Frontend
- Use Bootstrap classes primarily, custom CSS for brand-specific styling
- Organize CSS with comments and logical sections
- Keep JavaScript functions small and focused
- Use consistent naming conventions across files

### File Naming
- **Views**: kebab-case (visual-inspection.blade.php)
- **CSS classes**: kebab-case (.body-panel-assessment)
- **JavaScript functions**: camelCase (highlightPanel())
- **Images**: kebab-case (front-bumper.png)

Remember: Provide explanations suitable for someone learning Laravel, not assumptions about advanced development knowledge. Always include the "why" behind technical decisions and Laravel-specific concepts.
# Interior Assessment Module
